# KNOWN ERRORS

# During /visit 

#'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' 

# Error on join_start

# 	This error is caused from new bots that the start button must be clicked instead of 
# 	using a /start command for some reason. This causes the script to not have a message to forward to host.

# 	This error also can be caused by a bot that is not responding due to server side issues
# 	or a connection issue on your side.

#	This error can also occur when a bot or user is banned or no longer exists. When this is
#	the case, it will also include a message with the error such as 'no user by this name could be 
#	found.'

#	To solve you can manually try or skip.


# Database locked

# 	Caused by the mobile device or connection which causes the script to continue to call for the
# 	session database.

#	To solve, simply go to the folder containing the session folder (location you placed the scripts)
#	and delete the phone session. This will default the script and it will await a new log in pin code
#	for the telegram account.


# /Join sometimes causes a temporary join ban.

####UPDATE####
#	Sleep timer added, still receive error\temp ban sometimes. Generally on a new account for the first time.
#	Ban is usually only 5-10 minutes. Run Join first, if banned go to visit or bots then back to join.	

#	This error we are currently working on a fix and will have one soon. It is caused by a group or 
#	channel with an inline message that has a human verification or a pinned message asking if you
#	accept their terms and conditions or their rules. The script will continue to try and join until 
# 	it receives a temp ban from joining.

#	To solve, you can go to the bot, and manually type /bots to trigger the next stage of the script.
#	This will cause the script to sleep and start again after the designated times. You can also close
#	the script with cntl+c and re-run after the given time is over.


# Data or internet connection disruption

#	This is caused due to a disruption in your connection. This could be a spike or momentary loss of 
#	connection or data. This will sometimes cause the script to stop in the sleep phase.

#	To solve, reset the script.
